# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). 

This is a fork of the original theme, where I removed everything below the fold, creating a single view template that is designed to be used as landing page that you then navigate away from.
